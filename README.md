algorithm-js
============

Implementations of classic algorithms in JavaScript. Sister repository to [algorithm-plusplus](https://github.com/jrpruit1/algorithm-plusplus)

Note: I already know that [algorithms.js](https://github.com/felipernb/algorithms.js) exists, and I'm not trying to steal from the popularity of that. I will probably be looking to that for guidance. I mostly just want to get better at writing algorithms and data structures in JavaScript, and hopefully this will help.

Feel free to give feedback or make suggestions. I might break this up into a module for every algorithm and data structure, each with their own tests and maybe one day their own repositories. Or maybe this will become a nice nodeschool.io lesson. In any case, the code will be well commented, node-able and browserify-able.

If you're interested in neat comparisons between this project and [algorithm-plusplus](https://github.com/jrpruit1/algorithm-plusplus), a C++ implementation of the same functions, check out my blog, [JavaScript Jake](http://javascriptjake.com/).
